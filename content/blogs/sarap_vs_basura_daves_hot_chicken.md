> It's hard to be so disappointed in chicken tenders, but we have to be fair!  
  
Hi everyone! For chicken week, Brian and I decided to take advantage of our cheat day by visiting this really popular chicken tender joint! It has been recommended to us by friends and even advertised through our friend's Instagram stories. Reviews on *Yelp* were raving, too, and we just had to see what all the hype was about.  
  
It took us a bit of drive, probably about a good 25-30 minute drive if there was no traffic. Parking at the restaurant already had us pretty excited, for the large chicken toy got us excited about our lunch that day. Walking in, there wasn't much of a line. We luckily made it before the lunch rush, so no one else was in the restaurant, but us and the workers. A glance on the menu already startled me.  
  
I ended up giving the prices the benefit of the doubt since everyone really liked this place, so I wanted to wait until I actually tasted the food. After we ordered, we noticed that they gave us a newcomers discount. (*Sweet!*)  
  
The atmosphere of the restaurant was so great. They decorated the walls with beautiful graffitia and a mural of a chicken toy as a basketball player! They really took *Space Jam* to another level. Once we got our food, we thanked and tipped the worker and went on our way. We decided to eat in the car, but that was the biggest mistake. It was almost 95ยบ in this area!  
  
Like the last restaurant we reviewed, we decided to have a little fun and keep a rank for the restaurants we go through. With that, we will rank taste, price, customer service, and overall for each restaurant in this way: ***Basura* -> *Kinda Basura* -> *Meh* -> *Kinda Sarap* -> *Sarap***, where Basura is straight up trash and Sarap is S+ tier quality.  
  
Fun fact: basura is trash and sarap is delicious in Filipino!
  
Overall, here is our ranking:
- Kiana's Ranking:
    - Taste: ***Meh*** -  The chicken tender was fresh and hot! I couldn't actually eat the food immediately after I got it since it was too hot to touch or eat. It did smell *phenomenal*, and that got me super excited to eat. Although, the hot chicken tender wasn't really hot. It could just be my tolerance to spice, but the weather made me sweat more than the chicken did. ): The chicken is really juicy though and large that it took me a while to finish one.
    - Price: ***Kinda Basura*** -  Even if the chicken tender was large, only two was not worth almost $11! It might be because of the quality of the chicken too, but if they added just one more or included more quantity to the sides (or add a drink), it might've been worth it. In addition to the two chicken tenders, I also got a handful of fries and a small container of sliced pickles and sauce.
    - Customer Service: ***Kinda Sarap*** -  The cashier we talked to actually took the time to explain what to expect. They did a really good pitch because I was expecting something else completely different, but I had to give that cashier credit.
    - Overall: ***Meh*** - The place didn't really live up to the hype, and I was honestly pretty bummed about it. I am still going to give this place another shot since restaurants do have their off days!

- Brian's Ranking:
    - Taste: ***Meh*** -  I ordered the two chicken sandwiches, which is basically just a chicken tender in between two buns with no sauce. Maybe I just eat a lot more than the average person, but the two chicken sandwiches felt like appetizers. The level of spice was not what I expected at all, but like Kiana, it could've just been my tolerance to spice. I also ordered mac n' cheese, and it made me feel like *Kraft* did a better job with theirs. The sauce was too mayo-y too. 
    - Price: ***Basura*** - Kiana payed for lunch today and our total came to be about $30-ish without counting the tip. It felt a little overpriced for *okay* food.
    - Customer Service: ***Meh*** - I felt cheated with the cashier's sales pitch, but I do have to give them credit for making the sale seem appealing. Everyone else on staff did look like they didn't want to be there, but it could just be an off day for everyone.
    - Overall: ***Kinda Basura*** - I can tell that this would be amazing to other people. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, but I don't think I would be going back.

There you have it, folks! A sensible review to the restaurant.
