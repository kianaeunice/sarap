> It's important to *try* to be healthy!  
  
Hello everyone! Today's blog post will focus on a restaurant I recently tried *Fresheria*. Recently, my partner, Brian, and I have been trying to better our health by going to the gym and bettering our diet with better quality meals/snacks. All I have to say for right now is that it's *expensive*, especially on two college students with bills! Nonetheless, the pandemic and quarentine for almost a year really took a toll on our health mentally and physically, and since we got our second Pfizer shot, we wanted to try and better ourselves as soon as we got our symptoms away!  
  
We share a membership to the nearest gym, *Planet Fitness*, and started slowly. We explored many of the machines. We also stayed away from anyone as much as possible and kept our masks on the whole time, with the exception of drinking water, of course.  
  
We also looked up places we can find healthier food if we didn't have enough time to cook. and that is how we found *Fresheria* that day. I ordered a turkey breast sandwich and a parfait that day. The prices were *waaaaaaaay* over our budget and we knew we couldn't keep going here. It would've been a lot cheaper to buy ingredients and make it at home too.  
  
Even with the price, we still thought that the food was so yummy. We didn't even think twice and gobbled it down the moment we got home. If we had the funds that day, we would've gone again. The portions were a little small, but there was **FLAVOR**, which was always a big plus on our part.  
  
We decided to have a little fun and keep a rank for the restaurants we go through. With that, we will rank taste, price, customer service, and overall for each restaurant in this way: ***Basura* -> *Kinda Basura* -> *Meh* -> *Kinda Sarap* -> *Sarap***, where Basura is straight up trash and Sarap is S+ tier quality.  
  
Fun fact: basura is trash and sarap is delicious in Filipino!
  
Overall, here is our ranking:
- Kiana's Ranking:
    - Taste: ***Kinda Sarap*** -  We did enjoy it and it was super tasty, but maybe we were just hungry?
    - Price: ***Meh*** -  It was way over budget at the time. Eating healthy really hurts the wallet. ):
    - Customer Service: ***Sarap*** -  This staff were patient and incredibly friendly with everything, and took the time to ask us about our day. Would love to go back just to see them again!
    - Overall: ***Kinda Sarap*** - I think I just need a full time job. Otherwise, I would go there a lot!

- Brian's Ranking:
    - Taste: ***Kinda Sarap*** -  Food was light and refreshing. It does live up to the name! Even if the smaller portions, It was delicious. They had a great pesto sandwich.
    - Price: ***Meh*** - They did use really fresh ingredients, so I understand why it was expensive, but as someone who eats a lot, this would hurt my wallet lol.
    - Customer Service: ***Sarap*** - There was a small team, but they still got our order ready before we even sat down!
    - Overall: ***Kinda Sarap*** - Other than the portion sizes, I think this is a great place, and I think everyone should give it a try, only if you have the funds for it. ):

There you have it, folks! Our first review post!  
  
#### Remember to always drink water, take a few minutes to breathe, and always get some rest.  
  
See you soon,
