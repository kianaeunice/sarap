> You can do ANYTHING with chicken breast except undercook it.  
  
Hi everyone! Happy to blog again this week. Today, I will talk about, what I think is, the best ingredient: chicken breast.  
  
In a previous blog post, I've mentioned that my partner, Brian, and I have been trying to eat healthy, and that meant we tried to meal prep. During the weekend, we bought enough chicken breast, brown rice, and assortment of veggies/sides for our meals for the week, and see what we liked and didn't like about the whole meal plan business.  
  
We did several things with the chicken breast, like breaded it with breadcrumbs to make katsu, baked it with lemon and other spices, or simply just seasoned it with soy sauce, salt, and pepper. What we realized was that at the end of the week, we were *so tired* of chicken and missed beef, pork, and fish. Although, we also felt really good from the slowly transitioning from white rice to brown rice and have veggies everyday. If we seasoned the chicken breast to be a little saltier or more sour, we would have a sweeter side, like salad with sweeter dressing or fruits instead.  
  
Call it a placebo, but we also had great progress with muscle gains from the gym. Maybe it's us feeling healthy, but we've never felt so good about ourselves in a long time.  
  
#### Remember to always drink water, take a few minutes to breathe, and always get some rest.  
  
See you soon,
Kia
