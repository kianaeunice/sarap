Hi everyone! Today, I will talk about my love-hate relationship with oat meal, the satisfying hot cereal meal that I've eaten for breakfast, lunch, and/or dinner!  
  
Last night, there wasn't any food at home or many groceries to make something. I didn't feel like ordering food since I wanted to save some money for when I move back to campus. Although, I remembered the one true thing that I always know that'll be there (besides bread): oat meal.  
  
I took a small pot and filled it with oat meal to cover the bottom of the pot. I put enough oat milk to submerge the oats and started to boil the oats over the stove. Because I like my oat meal a little thicker than most, I decided to cook it a little longer, and waited until it felt thicker. Once it did, I put it in a bowl.  
  
I added some granola, pieces of sliced banana, two spoons of brown sugar, and a splash of cold oat milk to cool it down. I guess I was so hungry last night that it felt like the best meal I've had in a while. I know there is a small debate about which kind of cereal is the best, hot or cold, and I think hot cereal totally beats this. It feels like I've been rejuvinated from the oat gods.  
  
Overall, if you haven't given oatmeal a try, please do! You can also customize it and experiement with it in your own way possible. Sometimes, I like to replace the brown sugar with condensed milk.  
  
#### Remember to always drink water, take a few minutes to breathe, and always get some rest.  
  
See you soon,
Kia
