Hi everyone! I hope you are all doing swell. Today's post will be focusing on the famous Oat Milk option.  
  
Since the end of high school, regular milk started to take a toll on me. (TMI) I always found myself longer in the bathroom or going throughout the day with tummy troubles or gas that I can't contain. I've been taking the time to try different alternatives for milk since then.  
  
Unfortunately, I didn't really know where to start. Most of my family don't have the same troubles as I do with milk, so I found myself on my own. I decided to go to friends who share the same trouble in hopes to get started. A few have mentioned almond milk as a great alternative. At first, I was living and breathing with almond milk, replacing it with cream in my coffee and using it as milk for cereal throughout the day. Although, I got tired of the sweet taste fast. I guess I used it so much that I got tired of it, and don't really want it anymore. Now the smell of it makes me not want it altogether. Still amazing though, and a great way to go for alternatives!  
  
Alas, I was still in peril. (Dramatic, huh?) I still wanted to keep milk in my daily diet. I decided to try something else I came across: oat milk. I made sure to ask everyone and anyone, even the internet, on which brands are top tier. I decided to try both the Target brand and the Chobani brand of oat milk. Since then, I could not stop using the Target brand oat milk. At first, it doesn't taste like anything. Really, it just tasted like water tainted with oats, but the more I used it, the more it gave an *oomph* to everyday meals/snacks. I think it worked perfectly for smoothies. Even putting a little too much did not make the smoothie taste milky at all.  
  
Right now, I am halfway through the Chobani oat milk. It has a stronger oat-y taste, but I still really enjoy it. It's great to replace water when making oatmeal too.  
  
Overall, the journey to find alternative milk products are still in progress. Even with the milk alternatives, I still find myself taking a Lactaid pill for ice cream and milkshakes.  
  
With that said, I hope you enjoyed today's blog!  
  
#### Remember to drink water, take a few breaths, and get some rest. You deserve it, and I am proud of you.  
  
See you soon,
