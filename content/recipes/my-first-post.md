> I have always wanted to create my own blog. With this class, I finally have the push to make it possible!  
Hi everyone! I hope you are all doing alright today. Although this blog post isn't much, I wanted to take the opportunity to actually say hello to anyone who might be reading this.  
Since the show *Awkward*, I have always wanted to create my own blog. Just having the power and jotting my thoughts down about anything was fairly exciting to me. Although, I never really found the opportunity to start, or even try. Thankfully, now I have the opportunity to!  
Keep in touch with any new recipes/blog posts you may come across.  
#### Remember to always drink water, take a few minutes to breathe, and always get some rest.  
  
See you all soon,  
Kia
