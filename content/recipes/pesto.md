## Directions
1. In a large pot, fill the pot with water and bring the water to a boil. Once at a boil, cook the pasta according to the box instructions.
2. Once the pasta is halfway done, place the olive oil and butter in a seperate pan or pot at medium-low heat.
3. Add the onion, tomatoes, and mushrooms. Cook until lightly cooked/seared. Try not to cook it all the way through.
4. Add the pesto. Mix around until all incorporated and sauce is nice and hot.
5. Drain the noodles leaving only 1-2 tablespoons of pasta water.
6. Add the remaining pasta water and pasta into the sauce. Mix around until pasta and sauce is all incorporated.
7. Add the parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Because everyone has their own tolerences towards spice, add more/less parmesan cheese and season to taste!
8. Once all incorporated, move pasta into a serving dish. Add pepper flakes or more parmesan cheese if you'd like.
9. Enjoy!
